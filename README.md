Codefundo 2018.  Phase 2 Idea submission

Problem:
According to the statistics, 68% of India’s land is prone to drought, 60% to earthquakes, 12% to floods and 8% to cyclones, making India one of the most disaster prone countries in the world, affecting overall 85% of Indian land and more than 50 million people. (source: nidm.gov.in)
Out of this large population almost  80% have access to basic Internet connectivity, But still most of them didn’t know what are the basic measures they should take during the impact.
 During Impact, affected people face lots of difficulty to locate relief camps and checkpoints.
After the Impact, Government declares so many relief plans but all of them are out of reach of the affected people.

  

Solution:
		It is clear from the above statements that most of the people are not aware of  better disaster management practises. 
To overcome this problem, we come up with a interactive web/App-platform that could guide them to prepare themselves for the upcoming disaster in such a way which would minimize their losses.
  During impact, website will be updated with the real time data of all the relief camps and other necessary updates. Users can also share their current locations which could help relief forces to track them. All the users in particular diameter get connected with each other through the platform where they can interact among themselves and keep each other emotionally motivated.
After the impact, in countries like India, it is too difficult to supply government aids or any other help to the affected people because either they don’t know about the compensations or they are located far or remote so that govt. not reach to them.
By our platform we encourage people to inform if they did not get  any help so that all the government organization and NGO’s got a better estimate of such people whom else they have to reach.
